# XIAO_ESP32C3_Battery_EAGLE-
EDA footprint and schematic for Seeed's Xiao ESP32C3

The foot print is based on Seeed's [open design for EAGLE](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/). As the Seeed [version](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_WiFi/Resources/XIAO-ESP32C3-v1.2_SCH-PCB.zip) does not have the battery pads, I've added them to encourage SMD connection of batteries.
